        This is an experiment in decision making. You will be paid in cash for your participation at the end of the
        experiment. Different participants may earn different amounts. What you earn depends on your decisions and the
        decisions of others.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment will take place through computer terminals at which you are seated. If you have any questions
        during the instruction round, raise your hand and a monitor will come by to answer your question.
        If any difficulties arise after the experiment has begun, raise your hand, and someone will assist you .

    <h1>General Instructions</h1>
    <p>
        This experiment consists of three parts. <br><br>
        In the first two parts you will be asked to make some decisions.
        You may earn some points depending on your decisions and the decisions of others.
        Your earnings for each part are determined separately.
        In the last part you will be asked to answer some simple questions.
        All your responses are confidential and will only be used for research purposes and will never be linked to your name.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the experiment, one decision will be randomly selected for payment.
        Your points in that decision will be converted to real currency at the rate of:
        1 point = 2.5 euros
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the instructions, we will ask you some comprehension questions. If you fail any of them, you will not receive any payment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next page, you will read the instructions for Part I of the experiment.

    <h1>Part I. Production stage</h1>
    <p>
        In this part, you will be matched randomly with other two players.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you will be matched with a randomly selected participant in the experiment to play the role of workers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your group of two workers will be matched with another player who will play the role of manager. In particular, the manager will be randomly selected from a pool of actual managers with practical experience in business settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        You and the other worker will have to make four decisions, one for each of the <u>four tasks</u> that you have to perform simultaneously in this stage of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each task, you will have 20 points to allocate between a <u>group account</u> and your <u>private
        account</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Group account</b>: All points allocated to the group account will produce a benefit for you, the worker you
        are matched with, and your group manager. In particular, the total sum of points allocated to the group account,
        by you and the other worker, will be <u>doubled by the experimenter</u>. Then the total amount will be divided between you, the other worker, and the manager according to some percentages.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Private account</b>: The points that you decide not to allocate to the group account will remain for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, your final earnings are determined by the following formula: <br><br>
        Final points = Points in your Private account + Your Percentage * 2 * (Total sum of points in the group account)
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Example 1</u>: you and the other worker in your group allocate to the group account 15 points each (and remain the
        other 5 points in your private account), the total sum of points in the group account is 30 points. If, for
        example, both you and the matched worker gets 40% of the group account, while your manager gets the remaining 20%, your final earnings would be:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Earnings from your Private account : 20 – 15 = 5 points</li>
            <li>Earnings from Group account: 40% of 2 * (30 points) = 24 points</li>
            <li>Total : 29 points</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        According to the same reasoning, your matched worker gets a total of 29 points (5 from Private account and 24
        from Group account), and your manager gets the 20% of the points in the group account (12 points).
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Example 2</u>: you decide to allocate all the 20 points to the group account, while the other worker in your group
        allocate nothing to the group account (0 points). If, for example, both you and the matched worker gets 40% of
        the group account, while your manager gets the remaining 20%, your final earnings would be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Earnings from your Private account : 20 – 20 = 0 points</li>
        <li>Earnings from Group account: 40% of 2 * (20 points) = 16 points</li>
        <li>Total : 16 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using the same reasoning, your matched worker gets a total of 36 points (20 from Private account + 16 from
        Group account), and the manager gets a total of 8 points (20% of points in the Group account).
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Example 3</u>: you and your matched worker decide to allocate all the 20 points to the group account. If,
        for example, both you and the matched worker gets 40% of the group account, while your manager gets the remaining 20%, your final earnings would be:
    </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Earnings from your Private account: 20 – 20 = 0 points</li>
        <li>Earnings from Group account: 40% * 2 * (40 points) = 32 points</li>
        <li>Total: 32 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using the same reasoning, your matched worker gets a total of 32 points (0 from Private account + 32 from
        Group account), and the manager gets a total of 16 points (20% of Group account).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: In each task you may get a different percentage. The corresponding percentage is indicated on the top row
        of the corresponding task. The rest of the total production will be divided between the other worker and the manager
        , but <u>you will not be informed about what percentage each one of them will receive</u>.

        In the first line you have “your percentage in the group account distribution for each task.
        In the second line, you have to decide how much points of your 20 points you want to allocate to the group account for each task.
