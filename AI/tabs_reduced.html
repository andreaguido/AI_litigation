    <h1>General Instructions</h1>
    <p>
        This experiment consists of three parts. <br><br>
        In the first two parts you will be asked to make some decisions.
        You may earn some money depending on your decisions and the decisions of others.
        Your earnings for each part are determined separately.
        In the last part you will be asked to answer some simple questions.
        All your responses are confidential and will only be used for research purposes and will never be linked to your name.
    </p>

    <h1>Part I. Production stage</h1>
    <p>
        In this part, you will be matched randomly with other two players.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you will be matched with a randomly selected participant in the experiment to play the role of workers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your group of two workers will be matched with another player who will play the role of manager. In particular, the manager will be randomly selected from a pool of actual managers with practical experience in business settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        You and the other worker will have to make four decisions, one for each of the <u>four tasks</u> that you have to perform simultaneously in this stage of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each task, you will have 20 points to allocate between a <u>group account</u> and your <u>private
        account</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Group account</b>: All points allocated to the group account will produce a benefit for you, the worker you
        are matched with, and your group manager. In particular, the total sum of points allocated to the group account,
        by you and the other worker, will be <u>doubled by the experimenter</u>. Then the total amount will be divided between you, the other worker, and the manager according to some percentages.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Private account</b>: The points that you decide not to allocate to the group account will remain for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, your final earnings are determined by the following formula: <br><br>
        Final points = Points in your Private account + Your Percentage * 2 * (Total sum of points in the group account)
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Example 1</u>: you and the other worker in your group allocate to the group account 10 points each (and remain the
        other 10 points in your private account), the total sum of points in the group account is 20 points. If, for
        example, both you and the matched worker gets 40% of the group account, while your manager gets the remaining 20%.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your final earnings are:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Earnings from your Private account : 20 – 10 = 10 points</li>
            <li>Earnings from Group account: 40% of 2 * (20 points) = 16 points</li>
            <li>Total : 26 points</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        According to the same reasoning, your matched worker gets a total of 26 points (10 from Private account and 16
        from Group account), and your manager gets the 20% of the points in the group account (8 points).
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Example 2</u>: you decide to allocate all the 20 points to the group account, while the other worker in your group
        allocate nothing to the group account (0 points). If, for example, both you and the matched worker gets 40% of
        the group account, while your manager gets the remaining 20%.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your final earnings are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Earnings from your Private account : 20 – 20 = 0 points</li>
        <li>Earnings from Group account: 40% of 2 * (20 points) = 16 points</li>
        <li>Total : 16 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using the same reasoning, your matched worker gets a total of 36 points (20 from Private account + 16 from
        Group account), and the manager gets a total of 8 points (20% of points in the Group account).
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Example 3</u>: you and your matched worker decide to allocate all the 20 points to the group account. If,
        for example, both you and the matched worker gets 40% of the group account, while your manager gets the remaining 20%.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your final earnings are:
    </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Earnings from your Private account: 20 – 20 = 0 points</li>
        <li>Earnings from Group account: 40% * 2 * (40 points) = 32 points</li>
        <li>Total: 32 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using the same reasoning, your matched worker gets a total of 32 points (0 from Private account + 32 from
        Group account), and the manager gets a total of 16 points (20% of Group account).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: In each task you may get a different percentage. The corresponding percentage is indicated on the top row
        of the corresponding task. The rest of the total production will be divided between the other worker and the manager
        , but <u>you will not be informed about what percentage each one of them will receive</u>.
