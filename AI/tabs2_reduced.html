    <h1>Part II. Negotiation-Production Game</h1>

    <p>In this part of the experiment,
    you will have to make similar decisions as in Part I. However, in this part,
        you will have to negotiate first with the other worker in your group the percentage that each one
        of you will earn from the total production.
    </p>
    <p>The negotiation of percentage is called the Negotiation Stage.</p>

    <h1>Description of the Negotiation stage</h1>

    <p>The Negotiation stage is played before the Production stage, and in this stage, you will negotiate on the percentages that determine your part of the total points allocated to the group account in each of the four tasks seen in the Production stage.</p>
    <p>You and your group member can choose among several possible percentages.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Agreement and resolution:</b> If the worker you are paired with and you reach an agreement on all the alternatives across the four tasks within the given time, your agreement will be implemented. That is, the percentages you agreed upon will be used to determine your group earnings.
    </p>

    <p>In case no agreement is reached within the given time, the percentages that will determine your earnings will be	  chosen by the manager.</p>

    <h1>Description of the Negotiation stage</h1>
    <p>The screenshot below is the page you will see in the Negotiation stage.</p>

    <p><u>How to indicate your preferred choice</u>: In the negotiation table, you will see the current choice of your group member, represented by a user icon in the column “Other”. To select your preferred percentage alternative, you must toggle the button in the column “My choice”.</p>
    <p>When the header of a column is grey, it indicates that no agreement is yet reached for that given task (for example, Task 1 in the screenshot). If a header turns green, it indicates that both you and your paired worker agree on the alternative to choose.</p>
    <p>Note: you will only be able to see your percentages and not those of your paired worker.</p>
    <p>You have the possibility to chat with the other worker in your group using the chat box. Any rude, racist, or disclosing of your identity risks immediate expulsion with no payoff.</p>
    <p>You and the worker you are paired with have 2 minutes for this stage.</p>

    <h1>Resolution of disagreements</h1>
    <p>In the case that you and the other worker do not reach an agreement about how to divide the total production for each task, a decision will be made to determine the percentages for both workers for each task.</p>
    <p class="card-body">
        {{ if player.subsession.treatment == "A"}}
        In particular, <u>an algorithm</u> designed to mimic the decisions made by actual managers will decide the percentage of the total production that each worker will obtain from each task. The algorithm will not have access to the proposal you and the other worker made in the negotiation stage or the messages that you exchanged in the chat.
        {{ else }}
        In particular, <u>the manager</u> you are paired with will decide the percentage of the total production that each worker will obtain from each task. The manager will not have access to the proposal you and the other worker made in the negotiation stage or the messages that you exchanged in the chat.
        {{ endif }}
    </p>
    <p>The remaining part of the production task not assigned to any worker will be kept by the manager.</p>

    <p>
        The timing of the negotiation-production game is the following:
        <ol>
            <li>First, you and the other worker will negotiate the percentage each one of you (and the manager) will get from each of the four production tasks.</li>
            <li>Second, you and the other worker will have to allocate 20 points between a group account and your private account for each of the four tasks.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        After the production task has been completed, earnings will be calculated. You will not be informed at this time of your total earnings for the corresponding period.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will play three rounds of the negotiation-production game. In each round, you will be matched with different individuals. None of you will be able to see the decisions or earnings from previous rounds.
